It is traditionally plain, but may also be seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese. The outer edge of the pizza is sometimes referred to as the cornicione.[40] Some pizza dough contains sugar, to help its yeast rise and enhance browning of the crust.[41]\r\n\r\nDipping sauce specifically for pizza was invented by American pizza chain Papa John's Pizza in 1984 and has since been adopted by some when eating pizza, especially the crust.[42]",

Under the Bourbon kings, Naples had become one of the largest cities in Europe ‚Äì and it was growing fast. Fuelled by overseas trade and a steady influx of peasants from the countryside, its population ballooned from 200,000 in 1700 to 399,000 in 1748. As the urban economy struggled to keep pace, an ever greater number of the city‚Äôs inhabitants fell into poverty. The most abject of these were known as lazzaroni, because their ragged appearance resembled that of Lazarus. Numbering around 50,000 they scraped by on the pittance they earned as porters, messengers or casual labourers. Always rushing about in search of work, they needed food that was cheap and easy to eat. <span class=\"highlightText\">Pizzas</span> met this need. Sold not in shops, but by street vendors carrying huge boxes under their arms, they would be cut to meet the customer‚Äôs budget or appetite. As Alexandre Dumas noted in Le Corricolo (1843), a two liard slice would make a good breakfast, while two sous would buy a pizza large enough for a whole family. None of them were terribly complicated. Though similar in some respects to Virgil‚Äôs flatbreads, they were now defined by inexpensive, easy-to-find ingredients with plenty of flavour. The simplest were topped with nothing more than garlic, lard and salt. But others included caciocavallo (a cheese made from horse‚Äôs milk), cecenielli (whitebait) or basil. Some even had tomatoes on top. Only recently introduced from the Americas, these were still a curiosity, looked down upon by contemporary gourmets. But it was their unpopularity ‚Äì and hence their low price ‚Äì that made them attractive.For a long time, pizzas were scorned by food writers. Associated with the crushing poverty of the lazzaroni, they were frequently denigrated as ‚Äòdisgusting‚Äô, especially by foreign visitors. In 1831, Samuel Morse ‚Äì inventor of the telegraph ‚Äì described pizza as a ‚Äòspecies of the most nauseating cake ‚Ä¶ covered over with slices of pomodoro or tomatoes, and sprinkled with little fish and black pepper and I know not what other ingredients, it altogether looks like a piece of bread that has been taken reeking out of the sewer‚Äô.When the first cookbooks appeared in the late 19th century, they pointedly ignored pizza. Even those dedicated to Neapolitan cuisine disdained to mention it ‚Äì despite the fact that the gradual improvement in the lazzaroni‚Äôs status had prompted the appearance of the first pizza restaurants.",

As far back as antiquity, pieces of flatbread, topped with savouries, served as a simple and tasty meal for those who could not afford plates, or who were on the go. These early <span class=\"highlightText\">pizzas</span> appear in Virgil‚Äôs Aeneid. Shortly after arriving in Latium, Aeneas and his crew sat down beneath a tree and laid out ‚Äòthin wheaten cakes as platters for their meal‚Äô. They then scattered them with mushrooms and herbs they had found in the woods and guzzled them down, crust and all, prompting Aeneas‚Äô son Ascanius to exclaim: ‚ÄúLook!
